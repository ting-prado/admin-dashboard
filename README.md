* Make use of the grid functions
* The outcome should look like this [image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png)

## Skills Emphasized in this Project:

* Emmet
* Flexbox
* Grid
* CSS Positions
* CSS Selectors
* Design/Layout Tool Nesting

## Thoughts After Completion

I like how the outcome of this project looked even though the design wasn't mine originally. I still had fun picking colors, names, and images used in this page. I could say that I've become more familiar with the flex and grid concepts, and when should one be used than the other.
